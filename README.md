# School Fees Billing Tool

This project is a web tool designed to automate the process of generating school fees bills for students. It was developed in response to a request from a local entity responsible for managing school fees payments, which previously involved manual typing or handwriting of bills.

## Features

- **Input Forms**: Users can enter student details and fees particulars through intuitive input forms.
- **Receipt Generation**: The tool generates receipts for both the school and the student/parent based on the input data.
- **Printing Functionality**: Receipts can be easily printed directly from the web interface.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for the structure and layout of the web pages.
- **React**: Employed for building interactive components and managing state.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utilized for styling the user interface with modern and responsive design patterns.

## Why React and Tailwind CSS?

Despite the seemingly small scale of this project, the decision to utilize React and Tailwind CSS was intentional. While other simpler solutions may have sufficed, incorporating React and Tailwind CSS served as an opportunity to deepen my understanding and proficiency with these technologies.

**React**'s component-based architecture and robust state management capabilities proved invaluable in handling the dynamic data and user interactions inherent in generating school fees bills. Additionally, leveraging React's Context API for global state management facilitated seamless communication between components, eliminating the need for cumbersome prop drilling.

**Tailwind CSS**'s utility-first approach offered unparalleled flexibility in styling the user interface. Although the project's requirements could have been met with traditional CSS or a CSS framework, the decision to use Tailwind CSS allowed for rapid prototyping and customization of the UI. Furthermore, incorporating Tailwind CSS provided exposure to modern design patterns and best practices.
